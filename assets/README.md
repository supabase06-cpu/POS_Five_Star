## Logo Requirements for Thermal Printing

To use your company logo on printed invoices, place a logo file named `logo.png` in this directory.

### Logo Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG
- **Color**: Pure Black & White (1-bit, no grayscale)
- **Size**: 380px to 400px wide
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or rectangular (height can vary)
- **Background**: Transparent or white

### Why These Requirements?
- **Black & White**: Thermal printers work best with pure black and white images
- **Specific Width**: 380-400px ensures optimal printing on 80mm thermal paper
- **No Grayscale**: Prevents dithering and ensures crisp printing
- **Small File Size**: Faster printing and less memory usage

### How to Create:
1. Start with your existing logo
2. Convert to black and white using image editing software
3. Resize to 400px width (height will adjust automatically)
4. Save as PNG with transparency
5. Name the file `logo.png` and place it in this directory

If no logo is provided, invoices will print without a logo but include the company name in text format.

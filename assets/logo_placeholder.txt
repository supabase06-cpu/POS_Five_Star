# Logo Placeholder

To add your logo:

1. Convert your logo to a black and white PNG image
2. Resize to 400px width (height will adjust automatically)  
3. Save as 'logo.png' in this assets folder
4. The logo will automatically appear on printed invoices

For now, invoices will print with text-only headers.

You can use the existing LOGO.svg file in the project root as a starting point.
Convert it to PNG format using any image editor or online converter.
